# LiDAR Crowd Analytics - Windows Application

## Overview

LiDAR Crowd Analytics is a professional Windows desktop application for analyzing 3D LiDAR datasets to generate crowd analytics and management strategies for event managers. This application helps event planners understand crowd density, movement patterns, and identify potential bottlenecks or safety concerns.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Data Import**: Support for industry-standard LiDAR formats (LAS, LAZ, PCD, PLY, XYZ, CSV)
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D point cloud visualization with customizable views
- **Crowd Density Analysis**: Identify crowd density hotspots and calculate occupancy metrics
- **Flow Pattern Analysis**: Analyze movement vectors and identify potential bottlenecks
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed PDF and HTML reports with actionable recommendations
- **Project Management**: Save, load, and manage multiple analysis projects
- **Database Integration**: Store analysis results in a local database for future reference

## System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- OpenGL 4.0 compatible graphics card
- 4GB free disk space
- Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 or equivalent processor

# LiDAR Crowd Analytics - Windows Application Design

## Application Architecture

The Windows application will be built using PyQt5 for the user interface, with the following components:

1. **Main UI Application** - A full-featured desktop application with ribbon menu, project management, and modern UI
2. **3D Visualization Engine** - Using OpenGL for high-performance point cloud rendering
3. **Analysis Backend** - Optimized algorithms for crowd density and flow analysis
4. **Database Integration** - Local SQLite with optional PostgreSQL server connection
5. **Report Generation** - Professional PDF report generation
6. **LiDAR Hardware Integration** - Direct connections to popular LiDAR sensors
